# ardu-n-back

A straightforward, text-only implementation of the dual [N-back task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back) for the [Arduboy](https://www.arduboy.com). 

Uses `N=2` (hardcoded) and position + letter for the questions.

## TODO

- [ ] Clarify the state machine, I think there's a gap
- [ ] Make N customizable in-game
- [ ] Store scores/settings/something
